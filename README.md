# Crochet Pattern Designer

This is a work in progress designer for crochet pattern diagrams ([these things](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0071/8235/2468/files/TE_AC_Solljus_Chart-1024x835.jpg)) that provides a more structured designing experience than what's current software offers. Right now, crafters are writing these diagrams out by hand, creating them in Photoshop, or using software that is not too different from the Photoshop "layer hell" experience. I seek to provide a Lego-like experience of snapping stitches together without sacrificing flexibility.
